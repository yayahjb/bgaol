 In simple terms, what this program does is to find
 the cells which are "close" to the cell given, in
 order to help find the Bravais lattice of highest
 symmetry consistent with the cell.

 A central problem in the solution of every crystal
 structure is to determine the correct Bravais lattice
 of the crystal. The Bravais lattices as they are
 usually listed are:

 aP  triclinic (anorthic) primitive
 mP  monoclinic primitive
 mS  monoclinic side-centered (C-centered)
 oP  orthorhombic primitive
 oC  orthorhombic side-centered (C-centered)
 oF  orthorhombic face-centered
 oI  orthorhombic body-centered
 hP  hexagonal primitive
 hR  hexagonal rhombohedrally-centered
 tP  tetragonal primitive
 tI  tetragonal body-centered
 cP  cubic primitive
 cF  cubic face-centered
 cI  cubic body-centered

 Failure to find the highest correct symmetry has several
 consequences, the worst of which is that the structure
 may not be solved. The least of the consequences is that
 some successor to Richard Marsh may publish a paper that
 points out the error, corrects it, and finds a better
 solution to the structure. Many methods have been
 described for finding the correct Bravais lattice. A
 summary of the published methods was published in the
 paper that described the G6 formalism (which is used
 in the program on this web page).

 The program on BGAOL implements a search in G6 for the
 various Bravais lattices that the user's cell may fit.
 For each lattice type, the best metric match is reported.
 If the higher symmetry type is actually correct, then
 that is likely to be the best cell from which to start
 further refinement. However, the possibility exists
 that one of the rejected cells (which did not match as
 well) was actually the correct one to use. The reason
 for this ambiguity is experimental error and its
 propagation in the transformations of the lattices
 in the program. Fortunately, the rejected cells are
 usually quite similar to the accepted one.

 A note on standard deviations: First, even in the best
 of circumstances, standard deviations of unit cell
 dimensions from 4-circle diffractometer data are always
 underestimated (by at least a factor of 2). In addition,
 the points chosen for the determination are often not
 well distributed (for example all in the first octant
 of orthorhombic lattices). These less than optimal
 choices cause substantial systematic error. The
 experimental errors are amplified in the mathematical
 conversions between various lattices that any lattice
 search program must perform. It is not a rare occurrence
 for angles to be incorrect by 0.5 degrees in initial
 unit cell determinations.

 Note: Even in most well determined unit cells, the actual
 errors in the edge lengths are 0.2 to 0.5 parts per
 thousand. (Note that reproducibility of the measurements
 is substantially better, leading to the illusion that
 diffractometers produce excellent unit cell parameters).
 Use of standard deviations that are too small is a
 common reason for failure of Bravais lattice searches.
 For small molecules, 0.1 Angstroms is a reasonable error
 for the edge lengths, for proteins, 0.4 to 0.5 (or even
 more for preliminary measurements). Accurate unit cell
 parameters must by determined by a number of more complex
 methods and must include extrapolation to remove systematic
 effects. For an excellent summary, see "Xray Structure
 Determination", G.H.Stout and L.H.Jensen, Wiley, 1989.

 Note on the name BGAOL -- gaols have lots of cells



INSTALLATION


The complete BGAOL suite consists of a the fortran
program BGAOL.FOR, which uses MKGAOL.FOR, near6.for
E3TOG6.FOR and MKREFL.FOR, the web page bgaol.html and
the cgi-bin script bgaol.csh.  The web page and script
need some definitions for each system.  They are built
from m4 macro documents by make, using a command file
Makefile, which must contain the appropriate definitions
or those definitions must be provided by defining environment
variables.

In order to install the program, you need to edit the file
Makefile, setting the following parameters appropriately for
your system:

HTTPDSERVER is the name of the server on which the installation 
is being made.  YOU MUST CHANGE THIS DEFINITION TO PERMIT 
REMOTE ACCESS.  The default definition is:

HTTPDSERVER	=	HOST.DOMAIN

The other variables you may need to change are

SEARCHURL, the URL what will be used to start searches
BINDEST, the path that will be used by the cgi-bin script to run
    the program, which will have the execution name bgaol
HTDOCS, the path of the directory into which to store the
    web page
CGIPATH, the URL of the cgi-bin directory
FC, the name of the fortran compiler to use (anything capable of
    fortran 77 compilations will do.  Builds have been tested
    with gfortran, g95, f77 and f2c
FFLAGS, compilation flags to use

You can see the starting vlaues for these variables by typing

make

Once you have edited them to suitable values

make install

will build and install the pieces of the program.


OPERATION

The program may be operated as a stand-alone program, reading
data from stdin, writing output to stdout and messages to stderr
or as a server program for the provided cgi-bin script.


You can see how the web version of the program runs at

which you are welcome to use routinely.
